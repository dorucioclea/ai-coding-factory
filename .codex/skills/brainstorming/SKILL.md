# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## Overview

Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through structured collaborative dialogue. This skill combines natural conversation with proven brainstorming techniques.

## When to Use

- Before implementing any new feature
- When exploring "what should we build?"
- When stuck on a design decision
- When requirements are vague or conflicting

## The Process

### Phase 1: Context Gathering

1. Check current project state (files, docs, recent commits)
2. Understand the domain and existing patterns
3. Identify constraints (tech stack, timeline, team)

### Phase 2: Idea Exploration (Choose a Technique)

Select the most appropriate brainstorming technique:

#### Technique 1: SCAMPER (for improving existing features)

| Letter | Question | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **S**ubstitute | What can be replaced? | Different auth provider? |
| **C**ombine | What can merge? | Combine list + detail view? |
| **A**dapt | What can be adjusted? | Mobile-first instead? |
| **M**odify | What can change size/shape? | Pagination vs infinite scroll? |
| **P**ut to other use | Can it serve another purpose? | Export data for analytics? |
| **E**liminate | What can be removed? | Remove rarely-used fields? |
| **R**earrange | What order can change? | Different onboarding flow? |

**Use when**: Enhancing or refactoring existing functionality

#### Technique 2: Six Thinking Hats (for complex decisions)

| Hat | Focus | Questions to Ask |
|-----|-------|------------------|
| ⚪ **White** | Facts | What data do we have? What's missing? |
| ❤️ **Red** | Feelings | What's our gut reaction? User emotions? |
| ⚫ **Black** | Risks | What could go wrong? Edge cases? |
| 💛 **Yellow** | Benefits | What's the best outcome? Quick wins? |
| 💚 **Green** | Creativity | What if we...? Wild ideas? |
| 🔵 **Blue** | Process | What's the plan? Next steps? |

**Use when**: Making architectural decisions or evaluating options

#### Technique 3: User Story Mapping (for new features)

```
                    User Journey (left to right)
    ┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
    │ Step 1  │ Step 2  │ Step 3  │ Step 4  │  ← Backbone
    ├─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
MVP │ Task A  │ Task D  │ Task G  │ Task J  │  ← Walking Skeleton
    │ Task B  │ Task E  │ Task H  │         │
    ├─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┤
v2  │ Task C  │ Task F  │ Task I  │ Task K  │  ← Enhancements
    └─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

**Use when**: Defining MVP scope for new features

#### Technique 4: Reverse Brainstorming (for problem-solving)

Instead of "How do we make X work?", ask:
1. "How could we make X fail completely?"
2. List all ways to cause failure
3. Reverse each into a solution

**Example**:
- How to make login fail? → Don't validate input → Solution: Add validation
- How to make it slow? → No caching → Solution: Add Redis cache
- How to confuse users? → No feedback → Solution: Add loading states

**Use when**: Identifying edge cases and failure modes

#### Technique 5: Mind Mapping (for exploration)

```
                    ┌─── Auth Method
                    │       ├── Email/Password
        ┌── Auth ───┤       ├── OAuth
        │           │       └── Magic Link
        │           └─── Roles
        │                   ├── Admin
        │                   └── User
Feature ┤
        │           ┌─── Create
        │           │       ├── Form
        ├── CRUD ───┤       └── Validation
        │           ├── Read
        │           │       ├── List
        │           │       └── Detail
        │           └── Update/Delete
        │
        └── UI ─────┬── Desktop
                    └── Mobile
```

**Use when**: Initial feature exploration, understanding scope

### Phase 3: Approach Selection

After brainstorming, present 2-3 approaches:

```markdown
## Approaches

### Option A: {Name} (Recommended)
**Pros**: {benefits}
**Cons**: {drawbacks}
**Effort**: {Low/Medium/High}
**Why recommended**: {reasoning}

### Option B: {Name}
**Pros**: {benefits}
**Cons**: {drawbacks}
**Effort**: {Low/Medium/High}

### Option C: {Name}
**Pros**: {benefits}
**Cons**: {drawbacks}
**Effort**: {Low/Medium/High}

**My recommendation**: Option A because {specific reasons}
```

### Phase 4: Design Presentation

Once approach is selected, present design incrementally:

1. **Architecture Overview** (200-300 words)
   - High-level structure
   - Key components
   - Check: "Does this structure make sense?"

2. **Data Model** (200-300 words)
   - Entities and relationships
   - Key fields
   - Check: "Does this data model cover your needs?"

3. **User Flows** (200-300 words)
   - Step-by-step journeys
   - Error cases
   - Check: "Does this flow match your expectations?"

4. **Technical Details** (200-300 words)
   - API endpoints
   - State management
   - Check: "Any technical concerns?"

### Phase 5: Documentation

After validation, write design to:
```
docs/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-{topic}-design.md
```

Include:
- Problem statement
- Chosen approach (and why)
- Architecture diagram (ASCII or Mermaid)
- Data model
- User flows
- Open questions
- Next steps

## Quick Brainstorm (5-10 min)

For smaller decisions, use this abbreviated flow:

1. **State the problem** (1 sentence)
2. **List 3 options** (bullet points)
3. **Pick one with reasoning** (2-3 sentences)
4. **Proceed**

```markdown
**Problem**: How should we handle image uploads?

**Options**:
1. Store locally (simple, limited scale)
2. Use S3/Cloudinary (scalable, extra cost)
3. Base64 in DB (no external deps, bloats DB)

**Decision**: Option 2 (Cloudinary) - scalable, has CDN,
free tier sufficient for MVP. Can migrate later if needed.
```

## Key Principles

- **One question at a time** - Don't overwhelm
- **Multiple choice preferred** - Easier to answer
- **YAGNI ruthlessly** - Remove unnecessary complexity
- **Explore alternatives** - Always consider 2-3 approaches
- **Incremental validation** - Present in sections, validate each
- **Document decisions** - Future you will thank you

## Integration

After brainstorming, continue with:
- `spec-driven-development` - Detailed requirements
- `planning` - Implementation planning
- `/scaffold` - Project setup
