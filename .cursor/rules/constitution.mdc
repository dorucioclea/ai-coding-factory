description: Define project principles and non-negotiables before any implementation. Use at project start to establish governance, quality standards, and architectural constraints.

**This constitution governs all development on this project.**
```

## Standard Principles to Consider

### For Enterprise Projects

```markdown
### I. Clean Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Domain layer has ZERO external dependencies. Application depends only on Domain.
Infrastructure implements interfaces defined in Domain/Application.

**Rationale**: Testability, maintainability, technology independence

**Enforcement**: Architecture tests fail build if violated

### II. Test-Driven Development

Tests MUST be written before implementation. Red → Green → Refactor.

**Rationale**: Ensures testability, documents behavior, prevents regression

**Enforcement**:
- Minimum 80% coverage for Domain/Application
- PR blocked without tests for new features

### III. Immutability First

Prefer immutable data structures. Mutations require explicit justification.

**Rationale**: Predictable behavior, easier debugging, thread safety

**Enforcement**: Code review checklist item

### IV. Explicit Over Implicit

No magic. Configuration over convention. Explicit dependencies.

**Rationale**: Readability, debuggability, onboarding speed

**Enforcement**: Code review, no reflection-based DI
```

### For Startup/MVP Projects

```markdown
### I. Ship Small, Ship Fast

Every feature should be deployable within 1-2 days. If larger, break it down.

**Rationale**: Fast feedback, reduced risk, maintain momentum

**Enforcement**: Sprint planning, story point limits

### II. Good Enough > Perfect

80% solution shipped beats 100% solution planned. Iterate based on feedback.

**Rationale**: Learn from users, avoid over-engineering

**Enforcement**: Time-box features, avoid scope creep

### III. Pragmatic Testing

Test critical paths and edge cases. Don't test framework code.

**Rationale**: Balance coverage with velocity

**Enforcement**: Focus on integration tests for APIs, E2E for critical flows
```

## Creating a Constitution

### Interactive Flow

When user starts a new project, ask:

**Question 1: Project Type**

| Option | Description | Implies |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| A | Enterprise/Long-term | Strict architecture, high test coverage |
| B | Startup/MVP | Pragmatic, speed-focused |
| C | Personal/Learning | Minimal constraints |

**Question 2: Team Size**

| Option | Implications |
|--------|--------------|
| Solo | Less documentation, flexible |
| Small (2-5) | Clear conventions, some docs |
| Large (5+) | Strict governance, full docs |

**Question 3: Key Principles (pick 3-5)**

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Clean Architecture | Layer separation, dependency rules |
| TDD | Tests before code |
| Immutability | No mutations |
| CQRS | Command/Query separation |
| Event Sourcing | Events as source of truth |
| Microservices | Service boundaries |
| Monolith First | Start simple, extract later |

### Output

Generate constitution based on answers, then:

1. Write to `docs/constitution.md`
2. Reference in project README
3. Create architecture tests to enforce (if applicable)

## Versioning

Use semantic versioning for the constitution:

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (principle removed, redefined)
- **MINOR**: New principle added, guidance expanded
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, typos, non-semantic changes

## Integration with Other Skills

- **spec-driven-development**: Reference constitution when validating specs
- **planning**: Check plan against constitution principles
- **code-review**: Verify changes comply with constitution

## Example Constitution

```markdown
# FishingSpots Constitution

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Ratified**: 2024-01-23
**Last Amended**: 2024-01-23

## Core Principles

### I. Clean Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The codebase follows Clean Architecture with strict layer separation:
- Domain: Zero dependencies, pure business logic
- Application: Orchestration, depends only on Domain
- Infrastructure: External concerns, implements Domain interfaces
- API: Composition root, HTTP concerns only

**Enforcement**: NetArchTest rules in CI pipeline

### II. Test-First Development

All features require tests written BEFORE implementation:
- Unit tests for Domain logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user journeys

**Enforcement**: Minimum 80% coverage, PR requires test plan

### III. API-First Design

Backend APIs designed and documented before frontend implementation.
OpenAPI spec is the contract.

**Enforcement**: API spec required before implementation starts

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- No warnings in build
- All public APIs documented
- No TODO comments in main branch

### Testing
- Domain/Application: 80% minimum
- Critical paths: 100%
- E2E: Happy path + top 3 error cases

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice | Locked |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Backend | .NET 8 | Yes |
| Frontend | Next.js 14 | Yes |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Yes |
| Cache | Redis | No |
| Auth | JWT | Yes |

## Governance

Changes to this constitution require:
1. Written proposal with rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing code
3. Approval from project owner
4. Migration plan if breaking

## Commands

```bash
# Create constitution interactively
/constitution create
