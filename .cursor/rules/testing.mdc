# Testing Standards

## Test Naming Convention
Use: `MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior`

## Test Structure
Always use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.

## Requirements
- Unit test coverage >= 80% for Domain/Application layers
- All tests must include Story trait: [Trait("Story", "ACF-XXX")]
- Use FluentAssertions for readable assertions
- Use Moq for mocking dependencies
- Use TestContainers for integration tests with real databases

## TDD Workflow
1. RED: Write failing test first
2. GREEN: Write minimal code to pass
3. REFACTOR: Clean up while keeping tests green
