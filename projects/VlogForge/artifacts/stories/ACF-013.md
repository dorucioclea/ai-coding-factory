# ACF-013: Shared Project Spaces

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: P1 - Must Have (MVP)
**Epic**: Collaboration
**Estimate**: L

## User Story

As **collaborators**, I want **shared project spaces** so that **we can coordinate joint content effectively**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Auto-Create on Accept
- **Given** a collaboration request is accepted
- **When** acceptance is processed
- **Then** a shared project space is automatically created with both creators as members

### AC2: Shared Content Calendar
- **Given** a shared project
- **When** collaborators view the project
- **Then** they see a shared calendar for joint content planning

### AC3: Shared Task List
- **Given** a shared project
- **When** a collaborator creates a task
- **Then** all project members can see and update the task

### AC4: Project Files/Links
- **Given** a shared project
- **When** a collaborator adds a file or link
- **Then** all members can access it (links stored, files linked to external storage)

### AC5: Project Activity Feed
- **Given** a shared project
- **When** any member takes action
- **Then** an activity entry is logged and visible to all members

### AC6: Leave/Close Project
- **Given** a project member
- **When** they leave or owner closes the project
- **Then** access is revoked but content created individually is retained

## Technical Notes

- Project is a lightweight container linking content items
- Implement project-scoped permissions
- Activity feed as event sourced log
- File links only (no direct upload to reduce storage needs)

## Dependencies

- ACF-005 (Content Ideas)
- ACF-006 (Content Calendar)
- ACF-011 (Collaboration Requests)

## Test Requirements

- Unit tests for project permissions
- Integration tests for shared content operations
- E2E tests for project collaboration flow

## Traceability

- Tests: `VlogForge.UnitTests/Domain/SharedProjectTests.cs`
- API: `GET /api/projects`, `GET /api/projects/{id}`, `POST /api/projects/{id}/content`, `POST /api/projects/{id}/tasks`, `POST /api/projects/{id}/links`
