# ACF-008: Task Assignment

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: P1 - Must Have (MVP)
**Epic**: Teams
**Estimate**: M

## User Story

As a **team lead**, I want to **assign content tasks to team members** so that **work is distributed and tracked**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Assign Task
- **Given** a team lead editing a content item
- **When** they assign it to a team member with due date
- **Then** the assignment is saved and the member is notified

### AC2: View Assigned Tasks
- **Given** a team member
- **When** they view "My Tasks"
- **Then** they see all tasks assigned to them, sorted by due date

### AC3: Update Task Status
- **Given** an assigned team member
- **When** they update task status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
- **Then** the status updates and team lead is notified of completion

### AC4: Task Comments
- **Given** a task with assignment
- **When** team members add comments
- **Then** comments are threaded and all team members can see them

### AC5: Overdue Highlighting
- **Given** tasks with due dates
- **When** viewing task list
- **Then** overdue tasks are highlighted in red

## Technical Notes

- Implement notification service (in-app, with email webhook)
- Index tasks by assignee and due date
- Track task history for audit

## Dependencies

- E2E tests for assignment flow

## Traceability

- API: `POST /api/content/{id}/assign`, `GET /api/tasks/mine`, `PATCH /api/tasks/{id}/status`, `POST /api/tasks/{id}/comments`
