# ACF-002: Creator Profile

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: P1 - Must Have (MVP)
**Epic**: Foundation
**Estimate**: M

## User Story

As a **creator**, I want a **public profile** so that **other creators can find me and learn about my content**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Profile Creation
- **Given** a newly registered user
- **When** they complete onboarding
- **Then** a profile is created with display name, bio (max 500 chars), and profile picture

### AC2: Profile Viewing
- **Given** any user (authenticated or not)
- **When** they visit a creator's profile URL
- **Then** they see bio, connected platforms, sample content, and collaboration availability

### AC3: Profile Editing
- **Given** an authenticated creator viewing their own profile
- **When** they click edit
- **Then** they can update bio, profile picture, niche tags (max 5), and collaboration preferences

### AC4: Collaboration Availability Toggle
- **Given** a creator on their profile settings
- **When** they toggle "Open to Collaborations"
- **Then** their profile shows/hides the collaboration badge and appears/disappears in discovery

## Technical Notes

- Profile pictures stored in S3-compatible storage (MinIO local dev)
- Implement image resizing (150x150, 400x400 variants)
- Cache public profiles in Redis (5 minute TTL)

## Dependencies

- ACF-001 (Authentication)

## Test Requirements

- Unit tests for profile validation rules
- Integration tests for profile CRUD operations
- E2E tests for profile editing flow

## Traceability

- Tests: `VlogForge.UnitTests/Domain/CreatorProfileTests.cs`
- API: `GET /api/profiles/{username}`, `PUT /api/profiles/me`, `POST /api/profiles/me/avatar`
