# ACF-003: Platform Connections (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok)

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: P1 - Must Have (MVP)
**Epic**: Analytics
**Estimate**: L

## User Story

As a **creator**, I want to **connect my YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok accounts** so that **I can see unified analytics across all my platforms**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Connect YouTube
- **Given** a creator on the integrations page
- **When** they click "Connect YouTube" and complete OAuth flow
- **Then** their YouTube channel is linked and initial data sync begins

### AC2: Connect Instagram
- **Given** a creator on the integrations page
- **When** they click "Connect Instagram" and complete OAuth flow
- **Then** their Instagram business/creator account is linked

### AC3: Connect TikTok
- **Given** a creator on the integrations page
- **When** they click "Connect TikTok" and complete OAuth flow
- **Then** their TikTok account is linked

### AC4: Disconnect Platform
- **Given** a creator with a connected platform
- **When** they click "Disconnect" for that platform
- **Then** OAuth tokens are revoked and connection is removed (historical data retained)

### AC5: Connection Status
- **Given** a creator with connected platforms
- **When** they view integrations page
- **Then** they see status (connected/disconnected/error) and last sync time for each

## Technical Notes

- Store OAuth tokens encrypted (AES-256) in database
- Implement token refresh logic for each platform
- Background job to detect and handle expired/revoked tokens
- Platform-specific API clients as separate services

## API Requirements

| Platform | API | Scopes Required |
|----------|-----|-----------------|
| YouTube | Data API v3 | `youtube.readonly` |
| Instagram | Graph API | `instagram_basic`, `instagram_manage_insights` |
| TikTok | Research API | `user.info.basic`, `video.list` |

## Security Impact

- HIGH: OAuth token storage - must be encrypted at rest
- Implement token rotation on refresh
- Audit log for all connection/disconnection events

## Dependencies

- ACF-001 (Authentication)

## Test Requirements

- Unit tests for token encryption/decryption
- Integration tests with mocked OAuth flows
- E2E tests for connection UI flow

## Traceability

- Tests: `VlogForge.UnitTests/Application/PlatformConnectionTests.cs`
- API: `POST /api/integrations/{platform}/connect`, `DELETE /api/integrations/{platform}`, `GET /api/integrations/status`
