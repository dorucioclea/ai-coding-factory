# ACF-014: Team Member Task View

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: P1 - Must Have (MVP)
**Epic**: Teams
**Estimate**: S

## User Story

As a **team member**, I want to **see my assigned tasks** so that **I know what to work on**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: My Tasks Dashboard
- **Given** a team member with assigned tasks
- **When** they view "My Tasks"
- **Then** they see all tasks assigned to them across all teams

### AC2: Task Grouping
- **Given** multiple assigned tasks
- **When** viewing task list
- **Then** tasks are grouped by status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)

### AC3: Due Date Sorting
- **Given** tasks with due dates
- **When** viewing within a status group
- **Then** tasks are sorted by due date (earliest first)

### AC4: Quick Status Update
- **Given** a task in the list
- **When** the member clicks the status dropdown
- **Then** they can update status without opening the full task

### AC5: Task Details Modal
- **Given** a task in the list
- **When** the member clicks the task title
- **Then** a modal shows full details including comments and history
