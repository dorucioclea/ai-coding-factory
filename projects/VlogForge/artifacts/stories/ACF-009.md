# ACF-009: Approval Workflows

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: P1 - Must Have (MVP)
**Epic**: Teams
**Estimate**: L

## User Story

As a **team lead**, I want **approval workflows** so that **content is reviewed before publishing**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Configure Workflow
- **Given** a team owner/admin
- **When** they configure workflow settings
- **Then** they can enable/disable approval requirement and set approvers

### AC2: Submit for Approval
- **Given** a team member with completed content
- **When** they submit for approval
- **Then** designated approvers are notified and content moves to "In Review" status

### AC3: Approve Content
- **Given** an approver with pending content
- **When** they approve the content
- **Then** status changes to "Approved" and creator is notified

### AC4: Request Changes
- **Given** an approver reviewing content
- **When** they request changes with feedback
- **Then** status returns to "Draft" with feedback visible to creator

### AC5: Approval History
- **Given** content with approval history
- **When** viewing content details
- **Then** full approval timeline is visible (who, when, action, comments)

## Workflow States

```
Draft → Submitted → In Review → Approved → Scheduled → Published
                  ↓
              Changes Requested → Draft (loop back)
```

## Technical Notes

- Implement state machine for workflow transitions
- Store approval history as event log
- Support multi-level approvals (optional future enhancement)

## Dependencies

- ACF-005 (Content Ideas)
- ACF-007 (Teams)
- ACF-008 (Task Assignment)

## Test Requirements

- Unit tests for state machine transitions
- Integration tests for approval flow
- E2E tests for approval UI

## Traceability

- Tests: `VlogForge.UnitTests/Domain/ApprovalWorkflowTests.cs`
- API: `POST /api/content/{id}/submit`, `POST /api/content/{id}/approve`, `POST /api/content/{id}/request-changes`
