# ACF-010: Creator Discovery

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: P1 - Must Have (MVP)
**Epic**: Collaboration
**Estimate**: M

## User Story

As a **creator**, I want to **discover other creators** so that **I can find collaboration partners**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Browse Creators
- **Given** a logged-in creator
- **When** they visit the discovery page
- **Then** they see a grid of creator profiles with pagination

### AC2: Filter by Niche
- **Given** a creator on discovery page
- **When** they select niche filters (gaming, lifestyle, tech, etc.)
- **Then** results are filtered to show only matching creators

### AC3: Filter by Platform
- **Given** a creator on discovery page
- **When** they select platform filters (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok)
- **Then** results show only creators active on those platforms

### AC4: Filter by Audience Size
- **Given** a creator on discovery page
- **When** they select audience range (1K-10K, 10K-100K, 100K+)
- **Then** results show creators in that follower range

### AC5: Search by Name
- **Given** a creator on discovery page
- **When** they enter a name in search
- **Then** results match display name or username

### AC6: Only Open to Collaboration
- **Given** a creator on discovery page
- **When** they toggle "Open to Collaboration" filter
- **Then** only creators with collaboration enabled are shown

## Technical Notes

- Implement full-text search with PostgreSQL
- Cache discovery results (5 minute TTL)
- Paginate with cursor-based pagination (20 per page)

## Dependencies

- ACF-002 (Creator Profile)

## Test Requirements

- Unit tests for filter logic
- Integration tests for search queries
- E2E tests for discovery flow

## Traceability

- Tests: `VlogForge.UnitTests/Application/DiscoveryServiceTests.cs`
- API: `GET /api/discovery?niche=&platform=&audienceMin=&audienceMax=&search=&openToCollab=`
