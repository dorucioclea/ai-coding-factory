# ACF-011: Collaboration Requests

**Status**: Ready
**Priority**: P1 - Must Have (MVP)
**Epic**: Collaboration
**Estimate**: M

## User Story

As a **creator**, I want to **send collaboration requests** so that **I can propose joint projects to other creators**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Send Request
- **Given** a creator viewing another creator's profile
- **When** they click "Request Collaboration" and write a proposal
- **Then** the request is sent and recipient is notified

### AC2: View Received Requests
- **Given** a creator with pending requests
- **When** they view their collaboration inbox
- **Then** they see all pending, accepted, and declined requests

### AC3: Accept Request
- **Given** a creator with a pending request
- **When** they accept the request
- **Then** both creators are notified and a shared project space is created

### AC4: Decline Request
- **Given** a creator with a pending request
- **When** they decline with optional reason
- **Then** the requester is notified of the decline

### AC5: Request Expiry
- **Given** a collaboration request
- **When** 14 days pass without response
- **Then** request auto-expires and requester is notified

## Technical Notes

- Implement notification preferences (in-app, email)
- Rate limit: max 5 requests per day per user
- Store request message (max 1000 chars)

## Dependencies

- ACF-002 (Creator Profile)
- ACF-010 (Creator Discovery)

## Test Requirements

- Unit tests for request state transitions
- Integration tests for request workflow
- E2E tests for request UI flow

## Traceability

- Tests: `VlogForge.UnitTests/Domain/CollaborationRequestTests.cs`
- API: `POST /api/collaborations/request`, `GET /api/collaborations/inbox`, `POST /api/collaborations/{id}/accept`, `POST /api/collaborations/{id}/decline`
