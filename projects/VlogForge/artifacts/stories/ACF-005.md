## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Create Idea

- **When** they click "New Idea" and fill in title, notes, and platform tags
- **Then** a new idea is saved with "Idea" status

### AC2: Idea List View

- **When** they view the ideas list
- **Then** they see all ideas sorted by creation date with filtering by status and platform

- **When** they click edit
- **Then** they can update title, notes, tags, and status

### AC4: Delete Idea
